🌐 Tuya BLE Plus — Offline Smart Control, Reinvented


Overview
-----------

Tuya BLE Plus is a fully offline Home Assistant integration that enables encrypted control of Tuya Bluetooth Low Energy devices—without the Tuya app, cloud pairing, or developer account.

This is a next-gen rewrite of ha_tuya_ble, rebuilt from the ground up to support:

🔐 AES-encrypted DPS decoding

💡 BLE service data parsing

📡 Multi-adapter and ESPHome BLE proxy support

📱 BLE fingerprinting by mac_address, product_id, and local_key

No Tuya tokens. No account. No internet. Just rock-solid local control.

🔧 Features
---------------

✅ 100% offline BLE pairing and communication 

🔒 Encrypted AES key handshake using your device’s local_key 

🧬 Decodes DPS payloads for sensor, switch, climate, lock, and Fingerbot devices 

📶 Native BLE signal strength and passive polling 

🛰️ Multi-adapter + ESPHome BLE proxy compatibility 

🧠 Flexible fallback logic for unknown product types 

💥 BLE event support (fingerbot_button_pressed) 

📊 Local-only sensors with auto-created device entities 

🎨 Polished device names, icons, and translation strings 

📁 HACS-friendly branding, docs, and config

🚀 Setup Instructions
-----------------------

1. Open Settings → Devices & Services

2. Click Add Integration → Tuya BLE Plus

3. If your device is broadcasting, Bluetooth discovery will pre-fill:

 - mac_address

 - product_id

 - device name

If not, you can enter the details manually:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|       Field         |                Description                        |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  MAC address        |       Bluetooth address (e.g. F4:A5:26:01:9C:3E)  |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Device ID          |      From Tuya app or tuya-cli output             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Product ID         |      Optional, helps resolve correct DPS mappings |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Local key          |      Required. Used to decrypt communication      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Name (optional)    |      Friendly name for the device                 |
