## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added

Refactored BLE packet handler with:

CRC16 validation

Fragment reassembly

Secure AES handshake and retry logic

Bluetooth discovery via async_step_bluetooth with automatic mac_address and product_id detection

DPS support for new Fingerbot features: programming state, idle positions, touch events

BLE signal strength sensor, battery enums, and icon switching based on enum value

Brandable .github/branding/ folder with polished icons, logos, and HACS banners

hacs.json metadata with discovery filters, iot_class: local_push, and description

Support for ESPHome BLE proxies and multi-adapter environments

### Changed

# Architecture

Replaced Tuya cloud auth with pure local key + DPS decoding for secure offline control

Hardened BLE communication stack (tuya_ble.py) with full disconnect handling, packet flow separation, and protocol versioning

Refactored datapoint parsing and dispatch into modular handlers

Restructured __init__.py, exceptions.py, and all platform files for modular, testable design

# UX & Platform

Unified device mappings and product metadata in devices.py for scalable, category-aware behavior

Rebuilt config_flow.py with manual setup and BLE discovery fallback

Refined entity update logic with flexible enum/icon mapping, signal strength support, and dynamic availability checks

Full codebase upgraded to align with Python 3.11+ best practices

All logging, error handling, and user-facing strings updated for clarity

# Removed

All cloud logic: token auth, Tuya IoT API calls, legacy polling or fallback mechanisms

Credential fetching via manager.py, cloud.py, and Tuya-linked config entries

# Breaking Changes

Old config entries that relied on Tuya cloud integration are not compatible

Devices must be re-added via the new config flow using their device_id, product_id, and local_key

See the [Local Key Guide](https://github.com/fragpic/tuya-ble-plus/wiki/Getting-Your-Local-Key)

You can safely uninstall the official Tuya integration—this version is fully local and does not depend on the cloud
